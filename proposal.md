My game is going to be a Isometric Rogue-Like that takes place in a neighborhood
where you go from yard to yard to defeat angry neighbors and eventually destroy
the HOA. Items are all randomized and the rooms will be premade but the order is
random. The items you pick up are different yard tools and they'll each have
different buffs and effects.

The layout and isometric view of hades I would like to use, along with an attack moveset that is similar to the spear.

I would like it so that you could jump, when your stuck in a yard the fence posts are stuck up,
but when you defeat everyone they go down enough that you can jump over them into the next yard.
A jumping mechanic is what I want to use from this.
